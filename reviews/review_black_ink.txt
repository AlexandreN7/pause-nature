                                <h2>What makes an ink waterproof ? </h2>
								Black ink is widely used in watercolor to bring contrast to painting, as in the line and wash technique. Today ink can be found in liquid form in 
bottles. 
                                But historically ink was kept solid in the form of stick. To cut a long story short, an ink is a solvent in which pigments floats. Once the ink is 
deposited
                                on the sheet, the solvent evaporates leaving only the pigments. The pysical force in charge of maintaining the pigments on the sheet is called "the 
vand des Waals force". 
                                This force can be more or less strong and wetting the paper can break this force and thus move the pigments. The ink is therefore not waterproof.

                                             alt="black_ink_presentation"></a>

                                In the case of waterproof inks, manufacturers add additives which carry out a chemical reaction when the ink dries. The chemical reaction modifies the 
chemical structure
                                of the ink, thereby strenghtening the van der Waals forces applied. It is important to note that an ink is never 100% waterproof and some stronger 
solvent like alcohol
                                can still break these forces and therefore earse the ink.


                                <h2>Criteria to consider</h2>
                                Here are the criteria to consider when choosing an ink:
								<o1>
							    <li>Water resistance - as indicated above, the effort to break the chemical bonds of the dried ink </li>
								<li>Intensity of black - quality and concentration of the blac pigment used</li>
                                <li>Clogging - can this ink be used with a fountain pen ? Will this ink kill my beloved brushes ? </li>
								</o1>
                        								
								<br>
                                <h2>Black ink benchmark</h2>
                                The waterproof criteria is essential for watercolor technique that require to wet inked paper. But a waterproof ink often sacrifies its flowability. 
                                For a single drawing it is absolutely necessary to avoid mixing 2 black inks together. Once dry, the inks may look radically different and ruin your 
work.
                                When not used, bottles of ink shall be kept corked as a prevention against thickening due to evaporation. when an ink bottle reaches the end of its 
life, its consistency
                                is thicker than a new one. That is why, it can be intereseting to keep a new bottle for the fine lines of a drawing. It is also possible to dilute 
with a bit of water the end of an old bottle.  
                                
								Finding the perfect black ink for watercolor can be a real challenge. During my watercolor adventure, I accumulated many bottles of ink,
								in the rest of this article I will compare them and give you my opinion on each brand.
                                <br>
								<br>
								For this comparison, I have selected the following inks:
								<o1>
							    <li>Winsor and Newton black indian ink (951)</li>
								<li>Random ink bought in china</li>
                                <li>Hero 234</li>
								<li>Sennelier indian ink "a la pagode"</li>
								<li>Pelikan fount india</li>
								<li>Platinum carbon ink</li>
                                <li>Pigma Micro (0.8)</li>
								</o1>
								<br>
								
								My benchmark is composed of 3 test cases :
								<o1>
							    <li>A writing sample with 30 seconds of dry time</li>
								<li>A writing sample with 5 minutes of dry time</li>
								<li>A writing sample with 30 minutes of dry time</li>
								</o1>

								Let's discuss about the results !
								<br>
								<br>
								<u>Winsor and Newton black indian ink (951)</u>
								<br>
								<o1>
							    <li>Water resistance : Very good </li>
								<li>Intensity of black : Very good </li>
								<li>Clogging : can't be used with a fountain pen</li>
								</o1>
								
								<br>
								<u>Random ink bought in china</u>
								<br>
								<o1>
							    <li>Water resistance : no resistance at all </li>
								<li>Intensity of black : greyish </li>
								<li>Clogging : can't be used with a fountain pen</li>
								</o1>
								
								<br>
								<u>Hero 234</u>
								<br>
								<o1>
							    <li>Water resistance : no resistance at all </li>
								<li>Intensity of black : good </li>
								<li>Clogging : some people on internet use this ink with fountain pen, i would not try it</li>
								</o1>
								
								<br>
								<u>Sennelier indian ink "a la pagode"</u>
								<br>
								<o1>
							    <li>Water resistance : Excellent when dry</li>
								<li>Intensity of black : best of the benchmark </li>
								<li>Clogging : really difficult to use, it clogs brushes and nib. This ink shall never be used with a fountain pen. I recommend diluting the ink with 
water to improve its fluidity. </li>
								</o1>

								<br>
								<u>Pelikan Fount india</u>
								<br>
								<o1>
							    <li>Water resistance : no resistance at all </li>
								<li>Intensity of black : good </li>
								<li>Clogging : compatible with fountain pen, but it should be cleaned regularly </li>
								</o1>								

								<br>
								<u>Platinum Carbon ink</u>
								<br>
								<o1>
							    <li>Water resistance : Excellent </li>
								<li>Intensity of black : Excellent </li>
								<li>Clogging : compatible with fountain pen, but it should be cleaned regularly </li>
								</o1>								
																
                                <br> 
								<h2>Conclusion</h2>
                                There is a lot of black ink out there. Right now my favorite is the Platinum Carbon ink combine with my lamy 2000. 
								Note : Noodler sell a bullet-proof ink which has very good reviews, probably worth a try.
