                               <p>Kuretake Gansai Tambi 10-color set was my first watercolor palette, back then i had absolutely no knowledge on watercolor and I decided to buy this palette probably because of its packaging. It was not even for the price, which at the time was higher than today (at least in Paris). I used it a lot and even decided to buy the 36-color set. Little tips, you can find these palette for cheap on chinese website ( shhhhhh ....).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First thing first, I did a color chart of my 36-color set. First observations :</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Good water activation</li>
<li>Some colors seem better than other. At first glance, red and green are intense while blue (except n&deg;67) and earthy tone seem pale.</li>
<li>Paint is opaque and glossy / bright aspect when dry</li>
<li>No granulation</li>
<li>Reactivate easily</li>
<li>Behaves differently in comparison to traditional watercolor</li>
<li>AP (approved product) Seal (non toxic)</li>
</ul>
<p><br />This watercolor is a mystery, there no information on pigment used or binder on the official website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On internet, we can read that this watercolor is not suited for mixing and it is adviced to use it directly from the pan. This behavior is due to the number of pigments constituting the color. Indeed, mixing 2 colors each constituted of several pigments tends to lead to a muddy color.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's make some experimentation !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chromatography is a method of chemical analysis allowing to separate the component of a mixture <span lang="en">by selective adsorption of the constituents.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">Here, i tried 3 solvent : water, alcohol and white spirit.</span></p>

<p><span lang="en">Here the results :</span></p>
<p><span lang="en">Conclusion </span></p>


                                <br> Conclusion ? It's my main travelling palette now :)
